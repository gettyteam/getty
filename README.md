## Go live and upload content on Odysee

Odysee is a blockchain-based media platform. We host all kinds of media such as images, articles, PDFs, audio files, etc., but we're best known for hosting videos. Odysee seeks to recapture the spirit of the early 2000s era internet. Rather than favouring corporate content such as late night talk shows, network television, and TV news, Odysee is a place for everyone, including independent creators.

## Do you want to use getty locally?

### Node.js

- Use your favorite terminal.
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22.x (the project requires Node >=22 <23).
- Enable Corepack (included with Node) so pnpm is managed automatically by the version pinned in `package.json`:

```bash
corepack enable
node -v   # should print v22.x.x
pnpm -v   # Corepack will provision pnpm@10.26.1
```

- Optional: install pnpm manually (if you prefer not to use Corepack):

```bash
npm i -g pnpm@10.26.1
```

## Installation

1. Install OBS Studio, Streamlabs or any software of your choice.
2. Clone this repository or download the files.
3. Open the terminal in the getty folder.
4. Optional: Copy env file and adjust values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Install dependencies with pnpm (via Corepack): **pnpm install**
6. Build the app with **pnpm run build** (runs the full pipeline: copies assets, builds admin + widgets with Vite, syncs `dist-frontend/` into `public/`, reapplies SRI, minifies legacy JS).
7. Alternatively, for faster widget-only iterations:
   - `pnpm frontend:build` – compile Vite widgets into `dist-frontend/`.
   - `pnpm sync:frontend` – copy the build into `public/` and refresh SRI attributes.
   - `pnpm add-sri` – re-run integrity hashing manually if you copy files by hand.
8. Start the server in production mode with **pnpm run start:prod**.
9. The server will run the app with the address http://localhost:3000.
10. Open getty in your web browser and configure your widgets in admin.

**Important:** If you download an update from getty, you must repeat the installation process. In some cases, there may be new dependencies to install, so the process may need to be repeated.

## Development workflow

- Run the backend in watch mode with Tailwind and the embedded Vite dev server:

  ```bash
  pnpm run dev
  ```

This single command serves every public page (landing, welcome, dashboard, 404) through Express on `http://localhost:3000`, while hot-module reloading is proxied internally from Vite.

- To disable Vite while developing static assets, set `GETTY_DISABLE_VITE_MIDDLEWARE=1` before running the command. Without Vite, the server falls back to the latest files inside `public/` or `dist-frontend/`.

- The standalone Vite port is no longer required; keep your browser pointed to `http://localhost:3000` for the entire experience.

- Widget build shortcuts:

  ```bash
  pnpm frontend:build  # compile only the Vite frontend
  pnpm sync:frontend   # copy dist-frontend/ → public/ with SRI reapplication
  ```

These two commands are useful when iterating on OBS overlays without running the full `pnpm run build` pipeline.

- OBS smoke tests: see `docs/widget-validation-notes.md` for the checklist used to validate each migrated widget (URLs, tokens, audio/TTS checks).

## Visit getty in the browser:

1. Welcome & landing: http://localhost:3000/ (first-time visits redirect to `/welcome` so you can choose a language, connect your wallet or login with Odysee).
2. Dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/user/<your-id-token>`
3. Admin: http://localhost:3000/admin/home

## How to add widgets to OBS?

1. Open the OBS Studio software.
2. Add a new "Browser Source".
3. Paste the URL of your widget: (e.g. http://localhost:3000/widgets/chat).
4. Adjust the size, position and color of each widget.
5. You're done! The widgets will appear in your stream. Let's stream!

> getty's vision is to help streamers on Odysee manage their own widgets for community interaction. This opens the door to multiple options and resources never seen before. Enjoy the app and look forward to more updates.
